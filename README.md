# HighC
HighC - Android game with singing

----------------------------------------------------------------

Crush incoming walls by singing into your phone's microphone.
Check the left meter for the required pitch and the right meter for the required volume.

Train in Free Play mode or select one of 64 available missions.
Recreate famous pieces of music like "Ode to Joy", "Swan Lake" or "Also Sprach Zarathustra".

Choose one of five available singers for different vocal ranges.

In some specific missions, singing will not be enough.
Try to experiment - sometimes you will need to shake your phone, touch the screen or be absolutely quiet.
